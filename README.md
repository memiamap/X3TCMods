Converts the specified target to remove the need for crystals.  Typically used to make Solar Power Plants operate without the need for crystals.

Note that removing crystals will cause a reduced output, in-line with NPC stations.

## [Sector Ship Killer](/Memia%20Sector%20Ship%20Killer)
Removes all ships and stations for the specified target race from player-owner sectors.

This can be used to allow *sector takeover* for the player, so that the player can take of (for example) Xenon and Kha'ak sectors without their ships and stations spawning continually.

## [Ship Mod](/Memia%20Ship%20Mod)
Adds a new ship model to the available ships that has increased firepower and large cargo space.
